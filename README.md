## Mo's Japan Travels

A fun little project for my friend, Mo. 
The problem: Mo's goal is to travel/visit all of the Japanese prefectures. He's been to a few, but he wants to see it visually on a map.
Additionally he wants to be able to update it at any time.

Frontend: Basic HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript for interactivity
Backend: Flask

Main Page: when you hover over the prefectures, a tooltip pops up to display what prefecture you are viewing

Edits Page: You can search the name of the prefecture and edit it when you have visited and what date.

When you click update, a little modal pops up to update the row:
